# filter calendar invites in Gmail

Calendar notifications email in gmail are difficult to filter and unlike outlook they dont get deleted from your mailbox if you accept or decline the event.

Below are two filters that works best:

1. subject:("invitation" OR "accepted" OR "rejected" OR "updated" OR "canceled event" OR "declined" OR "proposed") when where calendar who organize
2. from:(-me) {filename:vcs filename:ics} has:attachment
