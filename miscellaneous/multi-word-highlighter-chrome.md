# Mutli word highlighter in chrome

Recently I had to work on toggling a couple 1000 configuration manually on a webpage. The configurations were paginated and had to searched and made active. Since I had to do it just once I went with the brute force approach and started doing it manually. It took me around 10 minutes to active 50 of the configurations. 

Then I though to myself, there should be a extension of some sort that would highlight multiple words on a webpage instead of a single word. I searched the chrome store for couple of minutes and came across this extension - *Highlight This* [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/highlight-this-finds-and/fgmbnmjmbjenlhbefngfibmjkpbcljaj?hl=en-US]. This was a fantastic find and did exactly what I wanted. 

For the free version, it only allows 200 terms to be searched and all the terms that match, it would be highlighted. This made it easy for me to toggle the highlighted configuration rather than searching every term. 

This saved me couple of hours! Hopefully helps us you too!
